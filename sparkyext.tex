\title{Sparky reproducibility extension for NMR data analysis}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Sparky is a popular program for analysis of NMR data, including peak picking,
GSS construction, and GSS assignment.  It is designed for flexibility in that
it includes a Python interpreter and an API accessible from Python programs
which allows interaction with and manipulation of its data model.  This makes
it possible to write extensions which automatically perform complex
computational tasks.

I have implemented an extension which facilitates reproducible data analysis
by extending the Sparky data model such that additional data can be easily
collected during the analysis process.  This additional data is sufficient
to render the process reproducible.

This document discusses the concepts of the extended data model, as well as
how to use the extension for reproducible analysis.
